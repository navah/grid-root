**readme.md**

**top priorities**
* mobile buttons sans tabs (dim(2,2)?)
* font sizes for mobile don't need viewport units
* choose sub (vertical) mini-portfolio browser
* outline hydrothermal figures


**obvious todos**
* make mid-grid something other than dim(2,2), maybe do dim(1,4)
* make mobile bar-menu dim(2,1)
* change clickable area on mid-grid... different
* naming convention


**not yet implemented**
* wireframe per-tab-content
* panel class collected to mid-grid class
* match inline

**round 1 non-migrations**
* contour SVGs
* figure out what to do for PHP POST method??
* select and size x 4
    * probably matplotlib
    * best communication?
    * topics stand-in
    * widest net cast here

*migrations are organized locally*
